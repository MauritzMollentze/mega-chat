/** @brief Interface for implementing the SRTP fingerprint verification
 *
 * The fingerprint verification resembles the ZRTP verification, but uses
 * the Mega key infrastructure instead of manually verifying the security code.
 * The scheme is as follows:\n
 * Each peer generates a 32-byte random key called an fprMacKey.
 * Then encrypts it with the public RSA key of the remote peer and sends it to him.
 * The peer decrypts int with their private RSA key. Then each side generates
 * a SHA256 HMAC of their own media encryption fingerprint, keyed with the peer's
 * fprMacKey. Then sends it to the remote. The remote does the same
 * calculation for its own media crypto fingerprint, and compares what it received.
 * They must match.
